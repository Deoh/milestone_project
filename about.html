                        <p>Lauryn Hill broke through with multi-platinum-selling, Grammy-winning group <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugees">the Fugees</a>, but with her 1998 solo debut The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, the singer,
                            songwriter, rapper, and producer established herself as a creative force on her own. She successfully integrated rap, soul, and reggae into a singular sound.

                        <p>Eelectic, uplifting, and empowering, the allbum was often elted by younger artists as a touehstone. Following its sueeess, Hill was semething of an enigma, her recorded output limited to a live set, seattered compllation appearanees,
                            and a handful of collaiboratiens. Disenehantment with the entertainment industry, aleng with legal issues and erratie performances, did not lessen the impact of her 90s Worle Raised in south Orange, New jersey, Hill spent her

                            of hit slngles "Killing Me Seftly," "Ready oF Not," and "No Woman, No Cry."

                            musically (the Motown-esque singalong of "Doo Wop IThat Thing)") and lyrically (the nostalgic "Every Ghetto, Every City"). As Misedueation began a long reign on the charts through most of the fall and winter of 1998, Hill became
                            a national media icon, as magazines ranging from Time to Esquire to Teen People vied to put her on the cover. By the end of the year, as the album topped best-of lists, she was being credited for her part in assimilating hip-hop
                            into the mainstream. The momentum culminated at the February 1999 Grammy Awards, during which Hill took home five trophies from her 11 nominations, including Album of the Year, Best New Artist, Best Female R&B Vocal Performance,
                            Best R&B Song, and Best R&B Album the mest ever for a woman. Shortly after, she launched a highly praised national tour with Atlanta rappers OutKast.

                        <p>Hill continued shaping her solo career, though it hit some signifieant snags. She faced a lawsuit from musicians who claimed they were denied full eredit for their work on Miseducation a matter that was eventually settled out ef

The double-disc <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV_Unplugged_No._2.0">MTV Unplugged No. 2.0</a>                            appeared in May 2002 and documented a raw, deeply personal performance. It debuted at number three but equiekly slid off the Bilboard 200. During the next several years, her reeordings and performances were infrequent and erratic,
                            highlighted by a Fugees reunion for Dave Chappelle's Block Party. In 2013, she spent almest three MOnths in prison for tax evasion but was more active after her release. The fellewing year, the English-language version of the
                            Swedish documentary Concerning Violence was released with Hill as its narrator. She executive produced and recorded six songs for the 2015 release Nina Revisited: A Tribute to Nina Simone, including interpretations of "Feeling
                            Good" and "Black Is the Color of My True Love's Hair."
