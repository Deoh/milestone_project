<p>Eelectic, uplifting, and empowering, the allbum was often elted by younger artists
as a touehstone. Following its sueeess, Hill was semething of an enigma, her
recorded output limited to a live set, seattered compllation appearanees, and a
handful of collaiboratiens. Disenehantment with the entertainment industry,
aleng with legal issues and erratie performances, did not lessen the impact of her
90s Worle
Raised in south Orange, New jersey, Hill spent her youth listening her parents
multi-genre, mult-generational recerd eelleetion. She began singing at an early
age and snagged miner roles en television (As the Werld Turns) and in film (Sister
Aet It: Baek in the Habit). Her en-again/eff-again membership in the Fugees began
at the age ef 13, but was eften interrupted by beth the acting gigs and her
enrellment at Celumbla University. After develeping a follewing in the tri-state
area, the greup's first release- the mueh-hyped but uneven 1994 abum Biunted
en Reality- bembed, and aimost eaused a breakup. But with the multi-platinum
1996 release The Score, the Fugees beeame ene of the most promiñent fap acts on
the strength of hit slngles "Killing Me Seftly," "Ready oF Not," and "No Woman, No
Cry."
Hill followed it In August 1998 with The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, her first
sele release. Apart frem a eever ef "Can't Take My Eyes Off You," popularized by
Frankle Valli, each seng was either written oF €0-Written by Hill: she was also
credited with the arrangement and preduetion af the whole albuüm, which was
steeped in her eld-sehoel baekground, beth musically (the Motown-esque 
singalong of "Doo Wop IThat Thing)") and lyrically (the nostalgic "Every Ghetto,
Every City"). As Misedueation began a long reign on the charts through most of
the fall and winter of 1998, Hill became a national media icon, as magazines
ranging from Time to Esquire to Teen People vied to put her on the cover. By the
end of the year, as the album topped best-of lists, she was being credited for her
part in assimilating hip-hop into the mainstream. The momentum culminated at
the February 1999 Grammy Awards, during which Hill took home five trophies
from her 11 nominations, including Album of the Year, Best New Artist, Best
Female R&B Vocal Performance, Best R&B Song, and Best R&B Album the mest
ever for a woman. Shortly after, she launched a highly praised national tour with
Atlanta rappers OutKast,
Hill continued shaping her solo career, though it hit some signifieant snags. She
faced a lawsuit from musicians who claimed they were denied full eredit for their
work on Miseducation a matter that was eventually settled out ef eourt. After
some film projects fell through, she retreated from the musie seene as she Faised
her family and partially attributed her hiatus to feeling to0 6ompromised. The
double-disc MTV Unplugged No. 2.0 appeared in May 2002 and documented a
raw, deeply personal performance. It debuted at number three but equiekly slid off
the Bilboard 200. During the next several years, her reeordings and
performances were infrequent and erratic, highlighted by a Fugees reunion for
Dave Chappelle's Block Party. In 2013, she spent almest three MOnths in prison
for tax evasion but was more active after her release. The fellewing year, the 
English-language version of the Swedish documentary Concerning Violence was
released with Hill as its narrator. She executive produced and recorded six songs
for the 2015 release Nina Revisited: A Tribute to Nina Simone, including
interpretations of "Feeling Good" and "Black Is the Color of My True Love's Hair."
