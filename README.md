# Milestone project (Lauryn Hill website)

This website is built for the musician singer/songwritre Lauryn Hill

## UX

The site was made for fans and potential fans who wish to learn more about this artists history, albums, tour dates and possibly bookings for shows.

**Site owner's goal:**
The artist is interested in selling more of their music/merchandise, providing details of upcoming events aswell as getting more bookings for future events. 

## Features

features include:

- About page giving detail into the history of the artist.
- Tour section giving details of upcoming events.
- Music & video section providing streaming and purchase options for the artists albums along with music videos from the artist.
- Contact section allows users to input their name, email address and details of any events they may wish the artist to perform at.
- Social section provides links to artists social media pages.

### Features Left to Implement
- Photo gallery

## Technologies Used

- [HTML](https://html.com)

- CSS
    
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
    - The project uses **Bootstrap**, a front-end component libraryto to help build a responsive, mobile-first website.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com)
    - The social media, streaming and purchasing links use icons from **Font Awesome**.

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com)
    -  The project uses **Google Fonts** for the font styling of the website.

## Testing

The website navigation bar when clicked drops down with links to different section of the website, clicking these links should take you to the intended section of the page (the **ABOUT** icon should link to another html page). 
scrolling down the page should have the same effect.

The website should scale well from mobile to desktops, in particular with regards to the webiste heading, "about" text, album art and music video sizing.

The website should work similarly across different browsers and screen sizes.

### Certain issues discovered when navigating the website were:
- The navbar dropdown links doesn't properly indicate (highlight) what section of the website you are currently in.
- The scrollbar appears on the mobile version of the site.
- Using the carousel feature from bootstrap for embedded music videos from youtube confilicted with each other when trying to use the youtube nav icon (full screen, play/pause etc). the carousel next and prev button needed to be resized.
